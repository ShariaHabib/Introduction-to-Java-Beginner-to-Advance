# Datatypes, Variables & Arrays

### *Primitive data types:*
* byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
* short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
* int: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
* long: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
* float: 32-bit floating-point number (approx. ±3.40282347E+38F)
* double: 64-bit floating-point number (approx. ±1.79769313486231570E+308)
* boolean: true/false
* char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535)

### *Arrays*
* An array is a collection of values of the same data type.
* In Java, arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element has an index of 0.
* For creating an array,  int[] myArray = new int[10] 
* Initializing an array, int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
* To access an element of an array just use index i.e. int x = myArray[0] assigns the value of the first element in the array to the variable x.
* _Arrays have a fixed size, which means that you cannot add or remove elements once the array has been created. If you need to add or remove elements dynamically, you can use other data structures like ArrayList._
