### Introduction to Classes

###  *Classes:*
* A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in Java.
* It contains fields (variables) and methods (functions) that define the behavior and properties of objects.
* To create an object of a class, you must first instantiate it using the new keyword.

### *Methods:*
* A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.
* It can have parameters (input) and a return value (output).
* Methods can be defined inside a class, and they can be called by an object of that class.


### *Constructors:*
* A constructor is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created.
* It is used to initialize the fields of the object to some default or specified values.
* Constructors can have parameters, just like regular methods.

### *"this" :*
* "this" keyword refers to the current instance of a class.
* It is used to refer to the fields and methods of the current object.
* It is commonly used to disambiguate local variables and fields with the same name.
### *"new" :*
* "new" keyword is used to create an instance of a class.
* It allocates memory for the object and initializes its fields using the constructor.
* The new object is then assigned to a variable or used directly in the code.
