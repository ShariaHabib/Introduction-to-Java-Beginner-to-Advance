# History and Evolution of Java 

1. Java is called "OAK" at the time of its creation. Afterwards it named to Java. OOP is the core of Java.

2. Java has its own garbage control. when no reference of an object not exist then automatically deallocates the memory used by the object,its called Garbage Collection.

3. More features and less syntactical complexity then C++.

4. JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It is a software development kit that contains the tools and libraries needed to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), which is needed to run Java applications, as well as the compiler, debugger, and other utilities.

5. JRI stands for Java Runtime Interface. It is an interface that allows native code (such as C or C++) to access Java objects and methods. It is similar to JNI (Java Native Interface), but it is simpler and faster. It is mainly used by R (a statistical programming language) to embed Java code.

6. JIT stands for Just-In-Time. It is a technique that improves the performance of Java applications by compiling bytecodes (the intermediate representation of Java code) into native machine code at run-time. This way, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can execute the native code directly without interpreting it every time.

7. Why java?
    • Simple    • Secure    • Portable  • Object-oriented   • Robust    • Multithreaded     • Architecture-neutral      • Interpreted   • High performance  • Distributed
    • Dynamic
