# Overview of Java
*Priciples of OOP*

	1. Encapsulation: Mechanism that binds code and data together to keep safe from outside interference an misuse.
  
	2. Inheritance: Process by which one object acuquires the properties of another object. supports the concept of hierarchical classification. like dog can inherit Mammal class again which is under large class Animal.
  
	3. Polymorphism: Means "Many forms" Override a method by other method of same kind. One interface many methods. In other words, a single method can work with different types of objects, as long as those objects implement the same interface or have a common parent class. Polymorphism is important for creating reusable code and  implementing complex behaviors that depend on the context in which they are used.
