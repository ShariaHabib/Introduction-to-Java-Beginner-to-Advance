# Exception Handling 

* ### _Exceptions are events that occur during program execution that disrupt the normal flow of instructions._
* ### _Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations in your Java programs._
* ### _Java has a hierarchy of exception classes derived from the Throwable class, including checked and unchecked exceptions._
* ### _Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions, with multiple catch blocks for different exception types._
* ### _Explicitly throw exceptions using the throw keyword to create custom exceptions or propagate exceptions._
* ### _Best practices for exception handling include using specific exception types, logging exceptions, avoiding overly broad catch blocks, and not using exceptions for regular control flow._
* ### _Custom exception classes can be created by extending the Exception or RuntimeException classes._
* ### _Exception chaining allows passing the cause of an exception to a new exception for better error tracing._
* ### _Exception handling in multithreaded programs requires proper synchronization and error handling techniques._
