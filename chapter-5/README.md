# Control Statements

* The if-else statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
* The switch statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

### Loops
* The for loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times, with a specified start, end, and increment values.
* The while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
* The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.
