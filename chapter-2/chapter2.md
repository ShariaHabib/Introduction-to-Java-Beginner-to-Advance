# Overview of Java
### *Priciples of OOP*

1. Encapsulation: Mechanism that binds code and data together to keep safe from outside interference an misuse.
  
2. Inheritance: Process by which one object acuquires the properties of another object. supports the concept of hierarchical classification. like dog can inherit Mammal class again which is under large class Animal.
  
3. Polymorphism: Means "Many forms" Override a method by other method of same kind. One interface many methods. In other words, a single method can work with different types of objects, as long as those objects implement the same interface or have a common parent class. Polymorphism is important for creating reusable code and  implementing complex behaviors that depend on the context in which they are used.

### *Java Class*

A Java class is a template or blueprint for creating objects that define the properties and behaviors of those objects. Each object created from a class is known as an instance of that class.

In Java, classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class, and a code block that contains the class's properties and methods.

### *Main function in Java*
                public static void main(String[] args){
                      body
                }
 Here public is access modifier, static is keyword that means this function is belongs to class itself, void is return type, String[] args is parameter & main is the method.
