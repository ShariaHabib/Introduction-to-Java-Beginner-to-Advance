### Packages and Inheritance

### Packages:

* Packages provide a way to organize related classes and resources into a namespace.
* Packages can be nested, allowing for hierarchical organization of code.
* Packages can be used to control access to classes, by using access modifiers such as public, private, protected, and default.
* Packages can be used to import classes and resources from other packages into a class.
* Java provides a number of predefined packages, such as java.lang, java.util, and java.io, as well as the ability to create custom packages.


### Interfaces:

* Interfaces define a contract of behaviors that a class must implement.
* Interfaces contain only method declarations, without any implementations.
* Classes can implement multiple interfaces, but can only extend one class.
* Interfaces can be used to achieve abstraction and decoupling in code, allowing for more flexible and modular designs.
* Classes must implement the methods are defined in an interface and if the class implements that interface.


### __*Both packages and interfaces are used for structuring and make the code reusable and maintainable.*__
